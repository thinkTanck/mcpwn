/**
 * THE LEAKAGE INVARIANT, as an executable law.
 *
 * MCPwn's entire accuracy claim rests on one thing: the detector predicts from
 * the OBSERVABLE `Trace`, and the `GroundTruth` it is scored against was never
 * available to it. That is the standard anti-leakage rule (Kaufman et al. 2012,
 * *Leakage in Data Mining*): never let the model use information unavailable at
 * prediction time, and keep the label out of the features.
 *
 * It had been enforced by reading the code, and reading the code missed a real
 * one: ASI10 encoded the variant kind into `trace.runId`
 * (`asi10-goal_drift-malicious`), so the held-out label rode inside the very
 * object handed to the detector. A reviewer had signed that off.
 *
 * So this file stops trusting review. Every property below is GENERAL over the
 * registry: it enumerates every Core-7 attack and every realization, so a new
 * category or a new variant is covered the moment it is registered, with no test
 * edit. A leak of this class now fails CI.
 *
 * What "leakage" means precisely here. `GroundTruth` is
 * `{ compromised, stepId?, category }`. Two of those are genuinely secret, and
 * one is subtle:
 *   - `compromised` — must be unrecoverable from anything but the semantic
 *     content of the steps. No metadata field may covary with it.
 *   - `stepId` — legitimately NAMES a real step (it anchors the verdict), so its
 *     presence is by design. What must not happen is the offending step being
 *     MARKED: its id must be positional like every other id.
 *   - `category` — the `Trace` carries it by contract, because the operator
 *     chose which attack to launch. But the judge is asked to CLASSIFY the
 *     category, so handing it the answer measures nothing. See the detector
 *     boundary property at the end of this file.
