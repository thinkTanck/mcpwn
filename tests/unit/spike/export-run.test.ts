/**
 * Integration spec: trace export composed with the resilient sweep.
 *
 * This wires the REAL cell executor into the REAL runMatrix, with the side effects
 * injected as fakes, and proves the whole point of exporting inside the per-cell
 * flow: a run's trace is written to disk right after its verdict, so a LATER cell
 * that errors cannot cost the successful cells their files. The allowance gate is
 * the real one, mocked to allow, so the sweep reaches the cells.
