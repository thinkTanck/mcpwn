/**
 * EVERY PUBLIC SHIPPED ROUTE IS CWV-MEASURED IN CI.
 *
 * The Lighthouse gate used to collect exactly one URL (`/`). Every screen built
 * after that shipped with CWV numbers taken by hand on a developer machine and
 * never by the gate, which is the same asserted-versus-measured gap the rest of
 * this project exists to close. Worse, the gap was silent: adding a screen cost
 * nothing, so nothing ever noticed.
 *
 * This test makes it cost something. The route list is DERIVED from the App
 * Router tree rather than restated here, so a new `page.tsx` fails this test
 * until it is either added to `lighthouserc.json` or written down below with a
 * reason it cannot be collected.
