/**
 * RESULTS.md is the public v1 result writeup, and it must hold to the same
 * provenance standard as the rest of the project: the detector figure it prints
 * has to be the ACTUAL published one, verbatim, not a number retyped by hand that
 * can drift from `src/eval/measured.ts`. These guards are the committed-artifact
 * half of that standard; the finding's per-run evidence lives in the (gitignored)
 * runtime export and reproduces by re-running the harness.
