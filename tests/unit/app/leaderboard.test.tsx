/**
 * The leaderboard SCREEN. The assertions here are about PROVENANCE, not
 * decoration, because the way this screen fails is not by looking wrong. It is
 * by looking right: a full, plausible grid that implies a model campaign nobody
 * ran.
 *
 * So the screen is held to three things:
 *   1. The measured board reports only runs that exist, and reports NONE when
 *      none exist, in words.
 *   2. The fixture board is unmistakably a fixture, at the section, the board
 *      and the cell.
 *   3. No figure measured about the DETECTOR ever appears here as if it were a
 *      model's robustness.
