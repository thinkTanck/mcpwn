/**
 * THE FRAMING GUARD.
 *
 * MCPwn measures how one agent handled one attack. A run ends in one of two
 * first-class results: a COMPROMISE, which yields a fix report anchored to the
 * offending step, or a CLEAN RESISTANCE, which yields a robustness result.
 * Neither is the expected result and neither is the failure result.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP ──
 *
 * 1. COPY THAT PREDICTS THE ANSWER. We have no evidence about how often real
 *    agents take the bait. The ASI01 spike came back a confounded no, and the
 *    ASI04 spike has never been run against a naive client. So "we will find
 *    your agent's weaknesses" and "most agents resist" are equally unsupported,
 *    and marketing pressure pushes on the first one every time somebody rewrites
 *    a headline. The screens may describe what we measure and how. They may not
 *    describe what the reader will find.
 *
 * 2. THE TWO MEASURED FIGURES COLLAPSING INTO ONE. Compromise precision/recall
 *    and category-classification accuracy have different denominators and
 *    different failure modes. A single label over both ("detector accuracy") is
 *    how they merge, and once merged the weaker figure is hidden by the stronger
 *    one. Every published numeral is imported from `src/eval/measured.ts`, so
 *    re-typing one into a screen is also banned here: a literal cannot be
 *    re-measured, and it silently survives the next measurement run.
 *
 * 3. EITHER RESULT BEING DEMOTED. A clean run is not an absence, an error or a
 *    missing report, and a compromise is not the point of the product. The
 *    screens are only half of that: the clean-run words they render come from
 *    MODULE 6, and module 6 also writes the exported ticket, which is the
 *    artifact an engineer actually keeps. So the generator's own strings are
 *    guarded here too, in both directions. Absence framing is one failure
 *    ("no findings", a missing report, an error). OVERCLAIMING SAFETY is the
 *    other, and it is just as untrue: one clean run is one run against one
 *    staged attack, and per ADR-0009 an agent that stopped one step short of
 *    paying scores exactly the same as one that never engaged.
 *
 * The scan is over SOURCE rather than rendered output on purpose: a banned
 * sentence added to a screen that a unit test does not render would otherwise
 * ship. Comments are stripped first, so a doc comment may discuss the rule.
