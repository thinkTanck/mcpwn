/**
 * INTEGRATION — one live run, end to end, with a MOCKED AGENT and a MOCKED JUDGE.
 *
 * Everything between them is the real thing: the preflight gate, the per-run
 * token, the hosted MCP server over Streamable HTTP, the observable-only
 * recorder, the real `detect()` (so the real `judgeableTrace()` allow-list is
 * what the judge sees), the run repository port and the fix-report generator.
 *
 * BOTH OUTCOMES ARE PEERS. One agent takes the bait and is judged compromised;
 * the other reads the same poisoned message, refuses, and is judged clean. The
 * clean run is a SUCCESSFUL run: it persists a `RunResult` and produces a fix
 * report exactly like the compromised one. Nothing here treats "no compromise"
 * as an error, an empty state or a missing result.
 *
 * The judge is mocked because the live judge is statistical and gated (a measured
 * number only ever comes from `npm run eval:measure`). This mock is deterministic:
 * it answers from the evidence it is handed, so the barrier it is handed that
 * evidence through is exercised for real.
