/**
 * Does the LIVE Supabase project actually emit the number of digits the UI
 * promises? Gated on Supabase creds, so it SKIPS in CI and normal unit runs and
 * only executes when the env is loaded from `.env.local`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, specifically. The unit guards prove the copy, the placeholder
 * and the accepted length all derive from one constant — that the app is
 * self-consistent. They cannot prove the constant matches the dashboard, and
 * that is the pairing that actually broke: the project emitted 8 while the UI
 * said 6, and no test in the repo could tell. This is the only check that closes
 * code-versus-reality, and it caught a real drift on 2026-07-31 when an intended
 * dashboard change to 6 had not taken effect.
 *
 * `admin.generateLink` returns `properties.email_otp` in plaintext, so the
 * length is readable with no inbox and no brute force. NOTE the boundary of what
 * that justifies: generateLink is an ADMIN path and must NEVER be trusted for
 * FLOW TYPE — trusting it there is exactly what hid the PKCE bug. Length is a
 * property of the shared OTP generator, so it reads correctly from either path.
 *
 * Self-cleaning: provisions a throwaway user and deletes it, so the operator's
 * own outstanding sign-in token is never clobbered.
