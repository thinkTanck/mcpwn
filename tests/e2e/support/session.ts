/**
 * A REAL SIGNED-IN SESSION, ESTABLISHED THE WAY A REAL USER ESTABLISHES ONE.
 *
 * The signed-in `/connect` console and `/account` were the only shipped screens
 * with no axe scan at all, because reaching them needs a session and the suite
 * had no way to create one. Their accessibility evidence was unit tests over
 * roles and names, which is not the same thing as scanning the rendered page.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS CANNOT BECOME A PRODUCTION HOLE ──
 *
 * Because it adds NOTHING to production. There is no test-only route, no
 * bypass, no signed cookie minted behind the app's back, and no flag that
 * relaxes auth. Not one line of `src/` changed to make this work. The helper
 * below types an address into the real `/sign-in` form, clicks the real send
 * button, reads the code out of the email that was really sent, types it into
 * the real code field, and lets the real `verifyEmailCode` set the real session
 * cookies. Every guard production has still runs: the rate limiter, the
 * implicit-flow sender, GoTrue's own verification. If any of them breaks, this
 * test goes red — which is the point of running it.
 *
 * What CI supplies is not a credential, it is a whole disposable Supabase: the
 * `supabase` CLI's local stack, started on the runner and destroyed with it. Its
 * anon and service-role keys are the CLI's published local defaults, so there is
 * no secret to commit, to leak, or to rotate, and nothing this test touches
 * exists anywhere outside that runner.
 *
 * ── WHY THE CODE COMES OUT OF THE MAILBOX AND NOT OUT OF THE ADMIN API ──
 *
 * `admin.generateLink()` would hand us an OTP with one call and no mail server.
 * It would also make this test PASS while the real send path is broken, which is
 * not a hypothetical: the PKCE bug that shipped to production stored a
 * flow-state code instead of `sha224(email + otp)`, so every emailed code failed
 * to verify while the admin path kept working perfectly. A test that reads the
 * admin token would have been green throughout. Reading the code a user would
 * actually have received is the only version of this test that could have caught
 * it, so that is the version we run.
