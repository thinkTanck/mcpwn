/**
 * DETERMINISM, the hard-won kind.
 *
 * axe reads COMPUTED colour. The boot splash is a transient overlay kicked by
 * `requestIdleCallback` (1600ms timeout) and faded in over 320ms, so both
 * WHETHER it is on screen when the scan runs and HOW FAR THROUGH its fade it is
 * depend on how busy the main thread happens to be. Scanning mid-fade measures
 * half-transparent text and reports contrast no user ever sees: observed as low
 * as 1.07:1 for a control whose RESTING contrast is 5.2:1 and passes.
 *
 * That made this gate a coin flip. It passed on CI and failed locally on the
 * same commit, and it flipped verdict when an unrelated performance fix freed
 * the main thread and moved the idle callback earlier. Waiting for the splash to
 * detach is NOT enough either: when the splash has not appeared yet, that wait
 * resolves instantly and the scan races it on the way in. Measured 2 of 4 runs
 * failing that way.
 *
 * So the splash is suppressed outright, via the same session flag the component
 * itself honours. Every screen is then scanned in a settled state, every time.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, stated rather than papered over: this gate therefore does NOT cover
 * the splash's own accessibility. Its roles and labels are covered by
 * `tests/unit/components/splash/boot-splash.test.tsx`, but its CONTRAST is not
 * covered anywhere, because a 2.5s self-dismissing overlay cannot be scanned
 * deterministically without pausing it. Worth closing with a dedicated
 * reduced-motion scan; not closed here.
