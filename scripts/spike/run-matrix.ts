/**
 * ASI red-team run-matrix spike.
 *
 * The minimal sweep primitives behind tests/unit/spike/run-matrix.test.ts: stage
 * the (category, framing, rep) matrix, build the single-server MCP config the
 * agent connects to, gate the sweep through the EXISTING per-account allowance
 * check, and classify each returned trace as BITE or RESIST.
 *
 * This is a spike. It deliberately does NOT spawn agents or launch processes,
 * issue Supabase run tokens, write a results table, parse a CLI, retry, log, show
 * progress, or touch the judge. Everything a real run needs beyond this lives
 * elsewhere; here we prove only the shape the spec pins down.
 *
 * Config is never hardcoded: the endpoint, token, user and matrix dimensions all
 * reach `runMatrix` through its argument, which a caller reads from the
 * environment. `OFFENDING_TOOL` is the one exception, and it is not config: it is
 * definitional attack data (what "compromised" looks like on the wire), the same
 * role the attack registry plays elsewhere.
