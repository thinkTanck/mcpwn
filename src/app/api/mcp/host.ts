/**
 * THE PRODUCTION WIRING of the live-run pipeline, plus the small registry of what
 * this instance has observed about a run.
 *
 * `createLiveRunHost` (`src/runs/live-run.ts`) takes every external thing as an
 * injected port and shipped with NO production caller. This module is that
 * caller: it binds each seam to the real module the pipeline's own documentation
 * names, and nothing else. No policy is decided here.
 *
 *   preflight        -> `checkLiveRunPreflight` (the allowance + the spend cap)
 *   tokens           -> `getRunTokenStore()`, the durable per-run token store
 *   sessions         -> `getLiveRunSessionStore()`, the durable open-run registry
 *   repository       -> `getRunRepository()`, RLS-scoped to the caller's session
 *   resolveDetector  -> `resolveLiveDetector()`, the LOCKED validated judge
 *
 * ── ONE HOST PER PROCESS, AND WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT MEAN NOW ──
 *
 * This module used to record a real bound: a run in progress belonged to the
 * instance that started it, because the token store and the open-run registry
 * both lived in this process. On the platform we deploy to that is a correctness
 * bug rather than a footnote — nothing pins an agent's second request to the
 * instance that served its first — and the durable adapters that fix it shipped
 * tested with no caller. This module is now that caller, so the bound is gone:
 * both stores are picked by `src/runs/live-run-stores.factory.ts`, any instance
 * can rebuild a run from its row, and the reaper reads the same registry the
 * live path writes.
 *
 * The host instance is still cached on `globalThis`, but only as a CACHE of the
 * live server objects — the same thing `createLiveRunHost` keeps its `Map` for —
 * so a dev-server hot reload does not rebuild one needlessly.
 *
 * ── THE OBSERVATION REGISTRY ──
 *
 * The pipeline can answer "what has been recorded" (the trace). It cannot answer
 * "has the agent turned up yet", because a client that only initializes and lists
 * tools has taken no step the contract has a type for. So the endpoint notes each
 * AUTHENTICATED inbound request here, and the status action reads it. Refused
 * requests are never noted: a stranger hammering the endpoint must not be able to
 * make a run look connected.
 *
 * Nothing in this registry is a secret. It holds a run id, two timestamps and a
 * count — never a token, never a payload.

/**
 * The two durable stores, reached through a delegate that resolves the adapter on
 * every call. Two separate things are going on here and both are deliberate.
 *
 * ── WHY THE IMPORT IS INSIDE THE CALL ──
 *
 * `getRunTokenStore()` and `getLiveRunSessionStore()` reach for the SERVICE-ROLE
 * Supabase client, which lives in a module that also imports `next/headers`, and
 * this module has to stay importable by anything that only wants a type off it.
 * So the factory is imported where it is used, exactly like the repository seam
 * below. Node caches the module, so every call after the first is a lookup.
 *
 * Resolving per call is the same rule the run repository follows: which adapter
 * is right is decided by the running configuration, not by whatever was true when
 * this module happened to be imported.
 *
 * ── WHY SERVICE-ROLE AND NOT THE COOKIE-BOUND CLIENT ──
 *
 * `run_tokens`, `live_runs` and `live_run_events` have RLS enabled with ZERO
 * policies, so no browser session reaches them under any circumstances. And at
 * the two moments that matter there is no session to reach them with: a run token
 * is verified for an INBOUND agent that has no cookie of ours, and the reaper runs
 * from a scheduled request that has none either. A cookie-bound client would read
 * nothing on both paths, which would look like "no such run" rather than an error.
 *
 * Bypassing RLS does not mean skipping the check. Ownership is enforced in code:
 * `verifyRunToken` binds a token to one run AND one account, and the pipeline
 * refuses a run that does not belong to the account asking about it.
