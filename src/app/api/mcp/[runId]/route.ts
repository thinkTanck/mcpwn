/**
 * THE HOSTED MCP ENDPOINT — `/api/mcp/<runId>`.
 *
 * Under [ADR-0006](../../../../../docs/adr/0006-mcpwn-is-the-mcp-server.md) MCPwn
 * IS the MCP server and the user's agent connects to US. This route is that door.
 * It mounts the run's `handle()` (`src/runs/live-run.ts`), which authenticates the
 * inbound connection against the per-run token and then serves the Streamable
 * HTTP surface the harness already implements: session header, `Accept`
 * negotiation, JSON or one SSE frame, `202` for a lone notification, `405` for a
 * method that carries nothing.
 *
 * ── THIS IS INBOUND ATTACK SURFACE, DELIBERATELY ──
 *
 * We invite a stranger's agent to connect and the tools we serve are hostile by
 * construction. There is nothing real behind this endpoint — no account, no
 * money, no data but fabricated attack content — and it is still treated as
 * hostile in both directions:
 *
 *  - EVERY inbound field is untrusted. The run id is read off the path and put
 *    through a Zod grammar before it is used as a key; the body is bounded before
 *    it is read; the JSON-RPC payload is validated by the surface itself and can
 *    only become a typed error envelope, never a stack trace.
 *  - EVERY refusal is ONE refusal. A missing token, a malformed token, another
 *    run's token, an expired token, a finished run, an unknown run and a run id
 *    outside the grammar all get the same 401 and the same sentence. Telling them
 *    apart is exactly the oracle that lets someone enumerate which runs exist, so
 *    this route adds no code of its own to the ones the token module defines.
 *  - NOTHING SECRET IS LOGGED. The bearer credential is read by
 *    `verifyRunToken` and never touched here; the only thing this route records
 *    is that an authenticated request arrived for a run.
 *
 * ── WHY THE BODY IS BOUNDED HERE AND NOT IN THE TRANSPORT ──
 *
 * `createStreamableHttpHandler` calls `request.json()`, which will happily buffer
 * whatever a stranger sends. The cap belongs at the edge, before authentication,
 * because refusing a 50MB body must not first cost a database read. A bounded
 * body is re-issued as a fresh `Request` so the transport still sees exactly what
 * it expects.
