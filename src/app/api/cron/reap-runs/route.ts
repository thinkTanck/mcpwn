/**
 * THE SCHEDULED TRIGGER for the abandoned-run reaper.
 *
 * There is no scheduler inside this app, so the schedule is declared where the
 * platform reads it (`vercel.json`, `crons`) and it calls this route. See
 * [ADR-0012](../../../../../docs/adr/0012-abandoned-runs-are-completed-not-discarded.md)
 * for why abandoned runs are finished at all, and for exactly what is running
 * versus what still needs an operator to arm it.
 *
 * ── THIS DOOR IS THE WHOLE SECURITY STORY ──
 *
 * The job behind it asks the judge (operator money) and writes results into
 * accounts that are not the caller's, so the route is not something a stranger
 * may run. It is guarded by a shared value the operator configures as
 * `CRON_SECRET`, presented as a bearer credential, compared in constant time.
 *
 * It FAILS CLOSED, and that is the honest state of a fresh deployment: with
 * nothing configured, EVERY caller is refused, including the platform's own
 * scheduler. A cron route that ran for anyone who found the URL would be a
 * public button wired to the spend controls.
 *
 * Nothing about the configured value is logged, echoed, or named in a response.
 * The refusal says the same thing whatever was wrong with the request.
 *
 * ── WHY THE JOB DOES NOT USE THE CALLER'S IDENTITY ──
 *
 * A scheduled request carries no user session, so the cookie-bound Supabase
 * client would read nothing and the per-account allowance would count zero runs
 * for everybody — a gate that silently passes. The job is therefore wired to the
 * SERVICE-ROLE client, and the accounts are read off the run rows themselves.
 * Ownership is still set in code: `saveRun(userId, run)` writes the owner the
 * registry recorded, and the host refuses a run that does not belong to the
 * account it was asked about.
