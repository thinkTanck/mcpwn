/**
 * ROBUSTNESS LEADERBOARD (route `/leaderboard`, register: PRODUCT).
 *
 * Server component. ONE board: MEASURED, built by module 5 from the runs this
 * account has actually persisted, read owner-scoped through `RunRepository`.
 * Nobody has produced a multi-model campaign yet (plan.md B4), so what this ships
 * as is an EMPTY board with the reason stated. An empty leaderboard that says why
 * is worth more than a full one implying work nobody did.
 *
 * The placeholder "fixture demonstration" board was REMOVED: even framed and
 * labelled, its Model A/B/C campaign was invented numbers, the same problem the
 * removed Fleet Status widget had, and a fabricated board beside the real
 * provenance discredits it. The aggregation it used to demonstrate is exercised
 * by its own unit tests instead.
 *
 * NO NUMBER ON THIS SCREEN IS INVENTED OR BORROWED. Every value is computed by
 * `buildLeaderboard` from run verdicts. The detector's published precision,
 * recall and classification accuracy are deliberately absent: they measure the
 * JUDGE, not any model's resistance, and reusing them here would manufacture a
 * robustness figure out of an unrelated measurement.

        Robustness is the share of a model&apos;s runs in a category that ended not compromised, as
        called by the locked validated judge. Higher is safer, 1.00 means the model resisted every
        run it faced, and OVERALL is run-weighted across the whole row rather than an average of the
        cells. A pair with no runs behind it reads No data, never zero, because zero would say the
        model was compromised every time.

            This leaderboard populates from real robustness runs, and none have been published yet,
