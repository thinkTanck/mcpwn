/**
 * Home — the BRAND-register front door. The pitch + the measured-detector claim
 * + the Core-7 launcher + the sample trailer, composed to fit ONE viewport.
 *
 * Everything about the featured run is BOUND to the real sample `RunResult`
 * (run id, step total, compromise step) — no `RG-0472`/`/13` literals.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE PITCH IS ALLOWED TO PROMISE ──
 *
 * That we measure, and how. Never what the reader will find. We have no
 * evidence about how often a real agent takes the bait: the ASI01 spike came
 * back a confounded no and the ASI04 spike has never been run against a naive
 * client, so "we will find your agent's weaknesses" and "most agents hold" are
 * both unsupported and the first one is the tempting one. So the headline
 * names the two results a run can have and says which one you get is the
 * measurement. `tests/unit/app/framing.test.tsx` fails if that drifts back.
 *
 * TWO measured figures reach this screen, and they are structurally separated
 * because they are separate measurements: the compromise precision/recall, and
 * the category-classification accuracy (a different question over a smaller
 * denominator). Each sits in its own labelled group, named for the question it
 * answers rather than for "accuracy", because one heading over both is how they
 * merge and the weaker figure disappears behind the stronger one. Both live in
 * `@/eval/measured`, each welded to its own provenance line; neither may be
 * edited here.
