/**
 * Live Attack Replay (route `/runs/[id]`, register: PRODUCT, the hero). Server
 * component: resolves the run through `resolveRun` and hands the observable
 * `RunResult` to the client Replay, along with the provenance of its verdict.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF RUN reach this screen through one door. The sample is the no-key
 * demonstration and needs no sign-in; anything else is one of the signed-in
 * user's own PERSISTED runs, read owner-scoped through the repository port. An id
 * that is neither renders a labelled empty state. It used to fall back to the
 * sample, which would show a stranger a constructed demonstration under their own
 * run id.
