/**
 * Findings / fix report screen (`/findings/[id]`). Reads through `resolveFixReport`,
 * so everything on the page — category, severity, run id, offending step, prose,
 * remediation — binds from module 6's real `generateFixReport` output over a real
 * `RunResult`. An id that resolves to nothing renders a labelled empty state, not
 * a 404.
 *
 * The run behind the report is either the no-key sample (open to everyone) or one
 * of the signed-in user's own persisted live runs (owner-scoped at the repository
 * port and at the database). The resolver also supplies the verdict's PROVENANCE,
 * so the page never has to decide on its own whether what it is showing is a
 * demonstration or a live capture.
