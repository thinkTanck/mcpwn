 * throttling, swapping Geist into wrapping prose changed line counts and shifted
 * everything below (a ~0.2 CLS). The fallback is metric-matched, so the type
 * scale and measures are preserved; only the exact glyph shapes differ until the
 * cached font is used. CLS from fonts is then ~0 across every screen.

/**
 * `metadataBase` is the origin every RELATIVE metadata URL resolves against.
 * Without it Next.js falls back to `http://localhost:3000`, so a deployed page
 * advertises localhost Open Graph and canonical URLs. The origin is env-only
 * (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, defaulting to the canonical host) — see
 * `getSiteOrigin`.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT set here: `alternates.canonical` and `openGraph.url`. Next
 * merges metadata down the tree, so a value pinned on the root layout would make
 * EVERY page that does not override it claim the same canonical URL. A base plus
 * per-route relative URLs is the correct shape.
 *
 * The Open Graph / Twitter card is the SITE-level card, shared by every route
 * that does not override it. A screen behind sign-in has no link-preview
 * audience of its own, so one honest product card beats eight near-identical
 * ones; a route that earns a distinct share card sets its own `openGraph`.
