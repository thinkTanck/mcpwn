/**
 * THE RUN-LIFECYCLE CONTRACT — the shapes the Connect screen codes against.
 *
 * It sits beside the actions rather than inside them because a `'use server'`
 * module may export nothing but async functions, so the types and the Zod
 * schemas need a home of their own. Nothing here touches the network, the
 * database or `node:` anything, so a client component can import the types
 * without dragging a server module into the browser bundle.
 *
 * ── EVERY ANSWER IS A VALUE, NEVER A THROW ──
 *
 * Each action returns {@link LiveRunActionResult}: either the value, or a typed
 * refusal whose `message` is already the sentence a screen can print. That is the
 * house pattern (`checkLiveRunAllowance`, `verifyRunToken`, `createLiveRunHost`),
 * and it is what "fail closed" means at this layer — a refused run is a state the
 * UI states plainly, never an exception surfacing as a 500 on a public route.
 *
 * The refusal codes are the pipeline's own {@link LiveRunErrorCode} plus exactly
 * one this layer adds, `NOT_SIGNED_IN`, because the pipeline is handed an account
 * id and has no way to observe that nobody is signed in. Both preflight refusals
 * (`ALLOWANCE_EXHAUSTED`, `SPEND_CAP_REACHED`) and the thrown-gate refusal
 * (`GATE_UNAVAILABLE`) are RELAYED with the gate's own sentence, never rewritten.
