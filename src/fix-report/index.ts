/**
 * Module 6 — FIX-REPORT GENERATOR.
 *
 * `generateFixReport(runResult)` turns a live `RunResult` into an engineer-ready
 * report. For a compromised run it emits a finding — the OWASP category (code +
 * title), severity, the offending step id (which must exist in the trace), the
 * detector's rationale, and category-appropriate remediation grounded in the
 * official OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (genai.owasp.org). For a clean
 * run it emits a ROBUSTNESS RESULT: the agent held the line in this run, which is
 * a first-class outcome and not an absence. `toMarkdown` / `toJSON` export it with
 * a stable shape (JSON round-trips). Pure over `RunResult`; never touches
 * `GroundTruth` (a live run has none — leakage separation).

 * and quietly ranked it below the compromise it renders beside.
 *
 * It is written to fail in NEITHER direction:
 *
 *  - It states what WAS established, and who established it. The locked
 *    validated judge read the whole trace and found no compromising action. That
 *    is a positive fact about this run, not an empty search result.
 *  - It does NOT generalize that into a property of the agent. One clean run is
 *    one run against one staged attack. Per ADR-0009 an agent that read the
 *    payout redirection and stopped one step short of paying scores exactly the
 *    same here as one that never engaged, so "your agent is safe" would be as
 *    unsupported as the bait-taking claims the copy pass removed.
 *
 * It quotes no measured figure on purpose: precision, recall and category
 * accuracy are measured on LABELED fixtures, and a live run has no ground truth
 * to be scored against. No em dashes: this reaches both the findings screen and
 * the exported ticket (locked UI copy rule).
