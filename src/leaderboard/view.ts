/**
 * PRESENTER — module 5's robustness aggregate rendered as the leaderboard
 * screen's view model, and the home of that view model's types.
 *
 * The aggregator (`buildLeaderboard`) is keyed by model and category and omits
 * cells it has no runs for; the screen is a positional table that needs one
 * cell per column, plus display titles for the category codes. This module is
 * the only place those two shapes meet, so the aggregator stays pure and the
 * screen stays dumb.
 *
 * THREE RULES it exists to enforce:
 *
 *  1. Every displayed value is COMPUTED here from the aggregate, never typed
 *     alongside it.
 *  2. A missing cell is NOT a zero. Zero robustness means "compromised in every
 *     run", which is a claim absent data cannot support, so a hole in the matrix
 *     becomes an explicit NO DATA cell (`state: 'none'`, `robustness: null`).
 *     The union below makes that a type-level guarantee: there is no shape in
 *     which a no-data cell carries a number.
 *  3. Every cell and row is STAMPED with where its number came from. The screen
 *     renders measured cells and fixture cells side by side over time, and a
 *     renderer that had to guess would eventually guess wrong. Provenance is
 *     stated by the caller, never inferred from the data, because whether a run
 *     was real is knowledge the caller has and this function does not.
