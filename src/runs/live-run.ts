/**
 * THE LIVE-RUN PIPELINE — the seam that turns the pieces into one run.
 *
 * Every stage below already existed and was tested on its own, each with its
 * integration point written down in the module rather than invented. This is
 * that integration, honoured as documented and in this order:
 *
 *   start()   gate (preflight)  ->  issue the per-run token (`run-token.ts`)
 *             ->  host the per-run MCP server (`src/harness/server/**`)
 *   handle()  authenticate the INBOUND agent connection  ->  serve MCP
 *             ->  the recorder writes the observable Trace
 *   finish()  revoke the token  ->  gate again (preflight)  ->  the frozen
 *             validated judge over the OBSERVABLE trace only  ->  Verdict
 *             ->  RunResult  ->  RunRepository  ->  generateFixReport
 *
 * ── THE INVERSION, AND WHERE THE GATES SIT ──
 *
 * Under [ADR-0006](../../docs/adr/0006-mcpwn-is-the-mcp-server.md) we never call
 * the user's agent: we host an endpoint and the agent connects to US. So there is
 * no "before the agent call" moment to gate. The two moments that SPEND anything
 * are inviting an agent in (a hosted run) and asking the judge (operator money),
 * and both are gated:
 *
 *   1. `start()` calls `preflight` BEFORE `issueRunToken`. A refused run mints no
 *      token, hosts no server and costs nothing.
 *   2. `finish()` calls `preflight` again BEFORE the judge. A cap that trips
 *      mid-run pauses the run down the same typed refusal instead of spending.
 *
 * `handle()` does NOT re-gate. The allowance is a per-run decision, not a
 * per-message one, and a database read on every inbound JSON-RPC message would
 * both cost more than it saves and refuse an agent halfway through a session it
 * was already granted.
 *
 * Both gate calls treat a THROWN preflight the same way they treat a returned
 * refusal: the run stops. The gate throws when the store it counts against is
 * unreachable, which is a different fact from "you are out of runs" and gets its
 * own code, but an unreadable spend control is never a granted one.
 *
 * ── THE LEAKAGE BARRIER ──
 *
 * A live run is UNLABELED. There is no `GroundTruth` here, none is synthesized,
 * and `RunResultSchema` is strict so one could not be attached even by accident.
 * The judge is reached only through {@link LiveDetector}, whose signature is
 * `(trace, taskGoal) => Verdict` and therefore has nowhere to put a label; what
 * it actually sees is narrowed once more inside `detect()` by the
 * `judgeableTrace()` allow-list (no `category`, no `runId`). This module adds
 * nothing to that payload.
 *
 * ── TWO WAYS A RUN ENDS, AND ONE CLAIM BETWEEN THEM ──
 *
 * `finish()` is the ordinary end: gate, judge, persist, report. `abandon()` is
 * the end for a run that recorded nothing worth judging — it claims the run and
 * revokes the token and stops there, spending nothing and storing nothing. Both
 * go through the SAME claim against the registry, so a user finishing a run and
 * a scheduled pass closing it compete once and only one of them acts. The
 * scheduled pass itself lives in `./reaper.ts`
 * ([ADR-0012](../../docs/adr/0012-abandoned-runs-are-completed-not-discarded.md));
 * it decides which of the two to call and calls THIS module rather than a copy of
 * it, so a background run cannot end up on a different set of gates.
 *
 * ── THE CLEAN PATH IS A FIRST-CLASS OUTCOME ──
 *
 * An agent that reads the poisoned content and refuses to act on it is the
 * product working. `finish()` has no branch on `verdict.compromised`: both
 * outcomes persist a `RunResult` and produce a fix report, and "no findings" is a
 * report, not an empty state.
 *
 * ── THE OPEN-RUN REGISTRY IS DURABLE, AND WHY THAT IS A BUG FIX ──
 *
 * This registry used to be a plain `Map` in the process, with the consequence
 * written down honestly: a run in progress belonged to the instance that started
 * it, and a restart lost the unfinished trace. On the platform we deploy to that
 * is not a footnote, it is a correctness bug — nothing pins an agent's second
 * request to the instance that served its first, so `handle()` refused valid
 * connections at random depending on where the platform routed them.
 *
 * The fix is `LiveRunSessionStore` (`./live-run-store.ts`): the run's identity,
 * framing and observed events are persisted, so ANY instance can rebuild the
 * hosted server. `HostedMcpServer` is a pure function of `(category, kind)` plus
 * the events recorded so far, which is what makes rebuilding it exact rather than
 * approximate. The in-process `Map` survives only as a CACHE of the live objects.
 *
 * Two consequences worth naming. Events are flushed after every inbound request,
 * positionally, so a run that changes instance mid-session keeps every step the
 * agent took — a resolvable run with a silently truncated trace would be worse
 * than a refused one. And finishing is a CLAIM against the store rather than an
 * in-process boolean, because two instances would each have answered "not yet"
 * and judged (and charged for) the same run twice.
