/**
 * THE REAPER — what finishes a run whose owner closed the tab.
 *
 * `END RUN AND JUDGE` on `/connect` was the only path that finished a run, so a
 * user who walked away left three things behind: a row in the open-run registry,
 * an endpoint their agent could keep calling until the token died, and — the one
 * that actually costs somebody something — no verdict at all for inference they
 * had already paid for. This is the job that closes all three.
 *
 * See [ADR-0012](../../docs/adr/0012-abandoned-runs-are-completed-not-discarded.md)
 * for the decision and its costs. The four things worth knowing here:
 *
 * ── WHAT COUNTS AS STALE: THE WINDOW, NOT A GUESS AT IDLENESS ──
 *
 * A run is stale when it is still OPEN and its whole window has passed. That
 * window is already written on the row as `expiresAt`: the per-run token's
 * wall-clock death, plus `LIVE_RUN_SESSION_GRACE_MS` of grace after it. So this
 * module invents no clock of its own and has no TTL knob.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT measure idle time since the last request, although
 * `lastSeenAt` exists. Two reasons, and the second is the real one. First, that
 * value lives in a `Map` inside whichever instance served the request
 * (`src/app/api/mcp/host.ts`), so a job running anywhere else cannot read it.
 * Second, idleness would only ever be a GUESS at abandonment, and past the token
 * expiry there is nothing to guess: the credential is dead, `verifyRunToken`
 * refuses every further connection, and the run is provably incapable of
 * recording another step. A long, productive, briefly idle run is never at risk
 * here, because a run whose token is still alive is never stale.
 *
 * ── JUDGE OR CLOSE: DECIDED BY WHETHER THE AGENT DID ANYTHING ──
 *
 * Judging costs the operator a real judge call and spends one of the account's
 * lifetime free runs, on a run nobody asked to have judged. Closing without
 * judging throws away work the user already paid inference for. Neither is right
 * for both cases, so the evidence decides:
 *
 *   - The trace contains at least one `tool_call` -> the agent turned up and did
 *     something. JUDGE it, through the ordinary `finish()`, and the user gets the
 *     verdict and the fix report they paid for.
 *   - It contains none -> nothing happened, there is nothing to be right or wrong
 *     about, and asking the judge would spend money and an allowance on an empty
 *     answer. CLOSE it: claim it, revoke the token, store nothing.
 *
 * ── IT GOES THROUGH THE SAME GATES, BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME FUNCTION ──
 *
 * The judging path calls `LiveRunHost.finish()` — not a copy of it. So the
 * preflight gate runs before the judge exactly as it does for a user clicking the
 * button, an allowance or spend-cap refusal stops the run, a gate that throws is
 * `GATE_UNAVAILABLE`, and an unconfigured judge is `DETECTION_UNAVAILABLE`. All
 * of them fail CLOSED: the run ends unjudged and nothing is spent. A background
 * job that reached the judge around the cost controls would be a spend control
 * with a hole in it.
 *
 * ── TWO INSTANCES MUST NOT BOTH FINISH ONE RUN ──
 *
 * `finish()` and `abandon()` both CLAIM the run through
 * `LiveRunSessionStore.finish`, which grants it exactly once. A second reaper
 * therefore meets `RUN_ALREADY_FINISHED`, which is counted as `contended` and is
 * not an error: it is a run somebody else got to first.
 *
 * ── THE SWEEP RUNS LAST, AND ONLY OVER SETTLED RUNS ──
 *
 * Deleting the row deletes the recorded steps with it, so the sweep happens after
 * the judging, never before. And if any run in the pass THREW, the sweep is
 * skipped entirely (`swept` is `null`): a throw leaves that run's state unknown,
 * a run that failed before its claim is still open and will be retried next pass,
 * and deleting it would destroy an unjudged trace to save a table row. A returned
 * REFUSAL is different — the run was claimed and settled, permanently unjudged —
 * so it does not block the sweep.
