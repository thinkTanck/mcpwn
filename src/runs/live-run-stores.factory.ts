/**
 * Which adapter a live run's stores use — decided the same way
 * `getRunRepository()` decides it, and for the same reason.
 *
 * THERE IS NO DRIVER SWITCH, deliberately. Selection is purely "is Supabase
 * configured", so a deployment cannot end up on the wrong store because an env
 * var was misspelt, and an offline clone still boots with no credentials at all.
 *
 * WHY THE ADMIN CLIENT, WHEN THE RUN REPOSITORY USES THE COOKIE-BOUND ONE. The
 * `runs` table has owner policies, so a user's own session is exactly the right
 * identity to read it with. These two tables have RLS on and ZERO policies, so no
 * session reaches them by design: a run token must never be re-readable by the
 * browser it was issued to, and the open-run registry is server bookkeeping the
 * agent has no business in. That leaves the service-role key, used server-side
 * only. Ownership is still checked in code — `verifyRunToken` binds the token to
 * one run AND one account, and the live-run host refuses another account's run —
 * so bypassing RLS does not mean skipping the check.
 *
 * A fresh DURABLE adapter per call, like the run repository: the state that
 * matters is in Postgres, and the client object is cheap next to the work it is
 * about to do.
 *
 * ── THE OFFLINE ADAPTERS ARE ONE PER PROCESS, AND THAT IS NOT SYMMETRY ──
 *
 * The in-memory adapters ARE their state, so building a fresh one per call would
 * hand back a store that forgets every write the moment the caller returns: a
 * token saved by `start()` would be unknown to the very next request, and a run
 * created by one call would be missing from the next. They are therefore held on
 * `globalThis`, which also keeps a dev-server hot reload from stranding a run
 * behind a second, empty store. The durable adapters need none of this, because
 * they hold nothing.
