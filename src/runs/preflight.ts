/**
 * PREFLIGHT — the one gate a live run passes before it costs anything.
 *
 * [ADR-0007](../../docs/adr/0007-access-and-cost-model.md) decided two cost
 * controls, and until now each existed on its own: the per-account lifetime
 * allowance was built but never called, and the global spend cap was designed
 * but never built. Two gates a caller has to remember to call in the right order
 * is a gate that eventually gets called in the wrong one, so they are composed
 * here and a live-run entry point calls exactly this.
 *
 * ── ORDER, AND WHY A REFUSED RUN COSTS NOTHING ──
 *
 * Cheapest first, and both before anything is spent:
 *
 *   1. CONFIG (free). Both numbers are read and validated before any I/O, so a
 *      misconfigured cap surfaces as a `ConfigError` rather than being masked by
 *      whichever gate happened to answer first.
 *   2. THE PER-ACCOUNT ALLOWANCE (one account's rows). Served by the
 *      `(user_id, created_at desc)` index and scoped to the caller.
 *   3. THE GLOBAL SPEND CAP (every account's rows in the period, read with a
 *      privileged client). The expensive one, and it is never reached when the
 *      cheap one has already refused.
 *
 * The whole gate runs BEFORE the judge is resolved and before the agent is
 * invited to connect, so a refused run makes no model call and issues no run
 * token. That ordering is the point: a cost control that runs after the spend is
 * an audit log.
 *
 * ── FAIL CLOSED ──
 *
 * If the spend cap's own state cannot be read, this refuses. See
 * `./spend-cap.ts` for the reasoning; the short version is that an unreadable
 * spend control is an open tap, not a permissive one. A per-account PERSISTENCE
 * FAILURE is different and is deliberately allowed to propagate: "the run store
 * is unreachable" is not the same answer as "you are out of runs", the refusal
 * vocabulary has no honest code for it, and a rejected promise still fails
 * closed because no run starts either way.
 *
 * ── INTEGRATION POINT ──
 *
 * This composes the gates and exposes them. It does NOT invent a caller: the
 * live-run entry point (the `/connect` server action that issues a per-run
 * endpoint and token, and the hosted MCP server behind it) is being built
 * separately, and it calls this after authentication and before it spends:
 *
 *   const user = await requireUser('/connect');
 *   const decision = await checkLiveRunPreflight({
 *     userId: user.id,
 *     accountCreatedAt: user.created_at,   // optional; see below
 *   });
 *   if (!decision.allowed) return { ok: false, ...decision.refusal };
 *
 * `accountCreatedAt` is optional because a run cannot predate its owner's
 * account: omitting it counts from the epoch, which yields the same total and
 * can only ever over-count. Auth and RLS are untouched.
