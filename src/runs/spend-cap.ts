/**
 * The GLOBAL model-spend cap — the operator's budget backstop from
 * [ADR-0007](../../docs/adr/0007-access-and-cost-model.md).
 *
 * TWO CONTROLS, TWO DIFFERENT JOBS. The per-account lifetime allowance
 * (`./allowance.ts`) DISTRIBUTES the resource: it bounds what one account can
 * draw, so a single enthusiastic user cannot close the tool for everyone else.
 * It says nothing about the total, because a public tool gains accounts. This
 * module bounds the BILL: what every account together may spend in one billing
 * period. ADR-0007 rejects each of them alone and keeps both.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT MEASURES: billable live runs, not dollars ──
 *
 * Nothing in this application can read what the model provider has actually
 * billed. A dollar figure would have to be reconstructed from a hand-typed price
 * per token, and a number nobody measured is exactly what this project refuses
 * to ship. A run is the unit we can genuinely count, and under the LOCKED judge
 * (one pinned model, one pinned temperature, one frozen rubric, one judge call
 * per run) a run's judge cost is bounded and close to constant. So the count is
 * a PROXY for spend, and this comment is where it says so rather than a screen
 * claiming a currency figure it did not measure.
 *
 * The meter counts PERSISTED runs, which is a lower bound on runs started: a run
 * in flight has not been written yet. The cap can therefore be overshot by
 * roughly the number of runs running concurrently at the moment it trips. That
 * is a bounded, deliberate imprecision — this is a budget guard, not an
 * accountant — and it errs by a handful of runs, never by an unbounded amount.
 *
 * ── OVER WHAT WINDOW: the current UTC calendar month ──
 *
 * The liability being protected is a monthly invoice, so the budget refills when
 * the bill does. A LIFETIME global cap would permanently close a public tool the
 * first time it was popular, which defeats the point of being public. A ROLLING
 * window would be off-phase with the invoice, so the same configured number
 * would mean a different fraction of the bill every month. UTC rather than the
 * host zone, so the reset instant does not move with a deploy region.
 *
 * ── FAIL CLOSED ──
 *
 * If the meter cannot be read, this refuses. A spend control whose own state is
 * unknown is not a permissive spend control, it is an open tap, and the case
 * where the meter is unreadable is precisely the case where something is already
 * wrong. Every path that cannot produce a trustworthy count refuses: no meter, a
 * rejected read, and any answer that is not a finite non-negative integer.
 *
 * REFUSAL IS A VALUE, NOT A CRASH — the same house pattern as
 * `checkLiveRunAllowance` and `verifyRunToken`. The trip point pauses live runs
 * gracefully down the seam `resolveLiveDetector()` already established for an
 * unconfigured judge: a bounded, expected state the UI states plainly.
