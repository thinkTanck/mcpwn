/**
 * The per-run, per-account token that authenticates the INCOMING agent
 * connection — the credential [ADR-0006](../../docs/adr/0006-mcpwn-is-the-mcp-server.md)
 * puts in place of the user's own key.
 *
 * THE SECURITY MODEL INVERTED, SO THE CREDENTIAL DID TOO. We do not call the
 * user's agent, so we hold no key of theirs and there is nothing of theirs to
 * leak. What we do instead is host an MCP endpoint and invite a stranger's agent
 * to connect to it, serving tools that are hostile by construction. That endpoint
 * is INBOUND ATTACK SURFACE with nothing real behind it, and this module is the
 * lock on its door: one token, one run, one account, expiring with the run.
 *
 * WHAT A LEAKED TOKEN IS WORTH, DELIBERATELY: one sandboxed run of fabricated
 * attack content. It is not an account credential, it cannot read another run, it
 * cannot be replayed after the run ends, and it dies on a wall clock even if the
 * run is abandoned. That bound is the point of the design, not a side effect.
 *
 * ── THE FORMAT: a split token, `mcpwn_rt_<selector>_<verifier>` ──
 *
 * A single opaque secret would force verification to either scan every stored
 * hash or index the secret itself. So the token carries two independent random
 * halves (the selector/verifier split, as used by Django's and Laravel's signed
 * token stores):
 *
 *   - SELECTOR — 16 random bytes as 32 lowercase hex chars. A LOOKUP KEY, not a
 *     secret: it is stored in the clear because it is what the index is on, and
 *     on its own it authenticates nothing.
 *   - VERIFIER — 32 random bytes as 64 lowercase hex chars, i.e. **256 bits** of
 *     `crypto.randomBytes` entropy. THE secret. Only its digest is stored.
 *
 * Both halves come from `node:crypto`'s CSPRNG. `Math.random` is not a candidate:
 * it is neither seeded nor generated for unpredictability, and a token an
 * attacker can reconstruct from a few observations is not a token.
 *
 * Hex with `_` separators, not base64url, ON PURPOSE: base64url's alphabet
 * CONTAINS `_`, so a `_`-separated base64url token has no unambiguous parse. Hex
 * costs a few characters and buys a grammar that is one anchored regex, has a
 * fixed length, and cannot be split two ways. The `mcpwn_rt_` prefix makes a
 * leaked token identifiable on sight (and greppable by secret scanners) without
 * revealing whose it is.
 *
 * ── THE HASH: SHA-256, and why NOT a slow KDF ──
 *
 * The stored value is a single unsalted SHA-256 of the verifier. That is a
 * deliberate choice against the usual instinct, so here is the reasoning rather
 * than the default:
 *
 *   - A slow KDF (bcrypt / scrypt / Argon2) exists to make brute force expensive
 *     for LOW-ENTROPY, human-chosen secrets. This verifier is 256 uniformly
 *     random bits. There is no dictionary, no reuse, no shape to guess: brute
 *     force is already infeasible, and a work factor multiplies an infeasible
 *     number by a constant while multiplying our own per-request latency by the
 *     same constant.
 *   - That latency is not free HERE in particular. This credential is checked on
 *     an endpoint we openly invite unauthenticated strangers to hammer, so a
 *     deliberately expensive verification is a DoS amplifier pointed at us.
 *   - No salt, for the same reason: salts defeat precomputation across a
 *     guessable preimage space, and a uniform 256-bit space has none. Two tokens
 *     colliding is not a threat we can afford to worry about before the heat
 *     death of the universe.
 *   - What the digest IS for: making the stored row useless. A dump of this table
 *     yields no token that can be presented, which is the whole requirement
 *     ("never persisted in plaintext").
 *
 * If the verifier ever stops being high-entropy random — if anything
 * user-supplied is ever folded into it — this reasoning is void and the algorithm
 * must be revisited, which is why `algorithm` is recorded on every row.
 *
 * ── VERIFICATION: constant time, uniform refusal ──
 *
 * The digests are compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` on equal-length buffers,
 * so response time carries no information about how much of a guess was right.
 * A length mismatch (a corrupted stored digest) would make that call throw, so it
 * is checked first and fails CLOSED instead.
 *
 * Every refusal carries a typed {@link RunTokenError} with a machine-readable
 * `code` for OUR logs — and the SAME sentence, {@link RUN_TOKEN_REJECTION_MESSAGE},
 * for the wire. An unknown selector and a real selector with a forged verifier
 * are the same code, because telling them apart is exactly the oracle that lets
 * someone enumerate which halves of a token are real. Nothing in a refusal ever
 * confirms that a run, an account, or a token exists.
 *
 * ── EXPIRY IS BOUNDED ON TWO AXES ──
 *
 * 1. THE RUN ENDS. `endRun()` stamps `endedAt`, and a stamped record is dead
 *    regardless of the clock. This is the primary bound: the token is scoped to
 *    one run and it does not outlive it.
 * 2. THE WALL CLOCK. `expiresAt = issuedAt + ttl`. An abandoned run never reaches
 *    axis 1, so without this a token would live forever on an endpoint anyone can
 *    reach. Whichever bound trips first wins.
 *
 * Time is injected (`now`), never read implicitly inside a check, so the whole
 * lifecycle is tested deterministically without sleeping on a real clock.
 *
 * ── INTEGRATION POINT (deliberately not wired yet) ──
 *
 * This module is TESTED PURE LOGIC WITH NO PRODUCTION CALLER, following the
 * precedent `checkLiveRunAllowance()` set in `./allowance.ts`: the thing it
 * guards does not exist on `main`. Under ADR-0006 a live run means an agent
 * connecting to an MCP server WE host, and that server is unbuilt (plan.md B2).
 * Inventing a caller so the token had somewhere to live would make the wiring a
 * fiction, which is the one thing this repo does not do.
 *
 * When the live-run entry point lands, the two ends attach like this:
 *
 *   // /connect, after auth and AFTER checkLiveRunAllowance() grants the run
 *   const { token, record } = issueRunToken({ runId, userId: user.id });
 *   await tokenStore.save(record);
 *   return { endpoint: `${origin}/api/mcp/${runId}`, token };  // shown ONCE
 *
 *   // the hosted MCP endpoint, on every inbound request
 *   const decision = await verifyRunToken({
 *     store: tokenStore,
 *     presented: bearerFrom(request.headers),   // untrusted, straight off the wire
 *     runId,                                     // from the addressed URL
 *     userId: run.userId,                        // the account that run belongs to
 *   });
 *   if (!decision.valid) return unauthorized(RUN_TOKEN_REJECTION_MESSAGE);
 *
 *   // when the run finishes, or is stopped, or is swept
 *   await tokenStore.endRun(runId, new Date());
 *
 * The store lands on `supabase/migrations/0002_run_tokens.sql`, whose table has
 * RLS enabled and ZERO policies: no browser session can read it under any
 * circumstances, and only server-side code holding the service-role key reaches
 * it. Verification is server-side only; the plaintext token exists exactly once,
 * in the response to the issuing request, and is never rendered from storage
 * because storage cannot produce it.
