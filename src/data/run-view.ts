/**
 * WHAT A RUN SCREEN READS THROUGH.
 *
 * `/runs/[id]` and `/findings/[id]` serve two kinds of run, and until now they
 * served only the first:
 *
 *   sample — the no-key demonstration. A builder-constructed trace paired with
 *            the verdict the FROZEN validated judge actually returned for it
 *            (B3). Open to everyone: no sign-in, no database read.
 *   live   — a run the pipeline judged and PERSISTED, read back owner-scoped
 *            through `RunRepository` (RLS enforces the same ownership at the
 *            database). This is the run a user's own agent produced.
 *
 * Sample is tried FIRST, deliberately: it means sample playback never touches
 * auth or Postgres, so the trailer keeps working signed out and offline, exactly
 * as the access model requires.
 *
 * ── PROVENANCE TRAVELS WITH THE VERDICT ──
 *
 * Every view carries the sentence that says where its verdict came from, and the
 * two are resolved together. A sample says it is a constructed demonstration; a
 * live run says it is a live run. Neither label is ever written by a screen: a
 * screen that decides its own provenance is a screen that can be wrong about it.
 *
 * ── ONE FIX-REPORT TYPE ──
 *
 * The report is module 6's `generateFixReport` over whichever `RunResult` was
 * resolved, so both origins go through one generator and one `FixReport` type.
 *
 * ── OBSERVABLE ONLY ──
 *
 * A `RunResult` holds no `GroundTruth` (live runs are unlabeled and the schema is
 * strict), and nothing here adds one. Nothing is synthesized: what is not in the
 * trace does not reach a screen.
