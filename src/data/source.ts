 * later. Screens/components depend on this interface, never on the fixtures
 * directly. Everything returned is OBSERVABLE (no `groundTruth`).
 *
 * SAMPLE RUNS come from the REAL attack builders (module 2): the trace served for
 * each category IS `attacks.build(category, 'malicious').trace` — a single source
 * of truth with the attacks we build and measure. The paired verdict is RECORDED
 * from the frozen validated judge (see `sample-verdicts.ts`), never derived from
 * the held-out `GroundTruth` — the judge that produced it is blind to the label,
 * which is what keeps the leakage barrier real rather than cosmetic.
 *
 * FIX REPORTS come from the REAL module-6 generator (`@/fix-report`) over those
 * runs, so `/findings` renders the artifact the product actually produces instead
 * of a hand-authored stand-in for it.
