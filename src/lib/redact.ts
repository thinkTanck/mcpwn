/**
 * ONE redaction utility for every secret this app touches.
 *
 * `src/runs/run-token.ts` proved the no-log guarantee for a single credential:
 * its tests assert that no log line, no persisted record and no serialized error
 * carries the plaintext token, its verifier or its selector. That proof is real
 * but LOCAL. It holds because that module was written carefully, and it says
 * nothing about the judge API key, the service-role key, an emailed one-time
 * code, or whatever secret is added next. This module is the same guarantee made
 * general, and `tests/unit/lib/secret-leakage.guard.test.ts` is what keeps it
 * true for code nobody has written yet.
 *
 * ── THREE INDEPENDENT WAYS A VALUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SECRET ──
 *
 * 1. BY KEY. `{ password, token, apiKey, verifier, otp, presented, ... }` is
 *    redacted whatever the value looks like. Cheap, and it covers the common
 *    case of a caller passing a credential straight through.
 * 2. BY VALUE. The values actually configured in the environment
 *    ({@link SECRET_ENV_NAMES}) become NEEDLES: any string containing one has it
 *    cut out, at any depth, under any key, including inside the log message
 *    itself. This is what catches `` `POST failed for ${apiKey}` `` — a string
 *    whose key says nothing and whose content is the whole secret.
 * 3. BY SHAPE. Credentials with an unmistakable grammar are redacted with no
 *    configuration at all: our own `mcpwn_rt_..._...` run tokens, `Bearer`
 *    values, JWTs (the shape every Supabase key takes), `sk-`-prefixed API keys,
 *    and Postgres connection strings (which carry the database password). Shape
 *    matching is what protects a per-run secret that exists for one run and is
 *    therefore in no environment variable at all.
 *
 * NEEDLES HAVE A MINIMUM LENGTH (8). A three-character "secret" — the sort a
 * test fixture sets — would otherwise redact ordinary prose everywhere and turn
 * every log line into confetti. Short values are ignored rather than trusted.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is a last line of defence at the sink, not a licence to
 * hand secrets to loggers. The static half of the guard test still fails a build
 * that passes a secret-named identifier into a log call or an error message,
 * because relying on redaction to catch what discipline should have prevented is
 * one refactor away from a leak.
