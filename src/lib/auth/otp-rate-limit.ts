/**
 * Sign-up rate limiting on the emailed-code path — an ABUSE BACKSTOP, not the
 * cost control.
 *
 * READ THIS FIRST, BECAUSE IT IS THE PART THAT IS EASY TO OVERSELL. The primary
 * control on operator spend is the per-account LIFETIME free allowance
 * ([ADR-0007](../../../docs/adr/0007-access-and-cost-model.md),
 * `src/runs/allowance.ts`): each account's total draw is bounded at creation, so
 * no single user can drain the shared pool. This module bounds nothing about
 * spend. It exists because a lifetime allowance makes ACCOUNT CREATION the
 * attack surface: an allowance that resets with a fresh address is not a
 * lifetime allowance. So the job here is narrow — make minting accounts cost
 * time — and it is defence in depth behind email verification, which is the
 * backstop that actually requires a deliverable address.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT KEYS ON, AND WHY NEITHER KEY IS SUFFICIENT ──
 *
 * BOTH the address and the source, as two independent buckets, refusing if
 * either is over. Stated honestly, each alone is weak in a different direction:
 *
 *   - EMAIL keying is trivially rotated. `a+1@`, `a+2@` and a fresh mailbox are
 *     free, so it stops nobody from minting accounts. What it does stop is
 *     mail-bombing ONE address (a real abuse of a send endpoint, and the one an
 *     unrelated victim feels), and it bounds the operator's outbound mail bill
 *     per address.
 *   - IP keying punishes shared NATs. A university, an office, a mobile carrier
 *     and a CGNAT pool are all one key, so a limit tight enough to stop a script
 *     is a limit that locks out real users sitting behind the same address. It
 *     is also cheap to evade with a proxy pool.
 *
 * So the IP bucket is deliberately LOOSE (it is the one that bites innocents)
 * and the email bucket is TIGHT (it is the one an individual user controls). The
 * combination raises the cost of automated sign-up from free to mildly annoying.
 * It does not make it hard, and it is not asked to.
 *
 * ── NOT AN ACCOUNT-ENUMERATION ORACLE ──
 *
 * The limiter runs BEFORE the provider and is never told whether an address is
 * registered — `signInWithOtp` with `shouldCreateUser: true` treats both the same
 * anyway — so its decision cannot vary with registration status. That is
 * structural, and it is asserted rather than promised.
 *
 * The refusal is the same reasoning `run-token.ts` applies to `UNKNOWN`: one
 * sentence on the wire, a machine-readable `scope` for our logs only. The
 * sentence is {@link RATE_LIMITED_MESSAGE} — byte-identical to the copy the
 * PROVIDER's own rate limit already renders — so a limiter refusal, a GoTrue
 * refusal, a registered address and an unregistered one are one indistinguishable
 * response. It names no address, no bucket, no count and no window, because a
 * refusal that says which bucket tripped tells a prober which key it is fighting.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: a shared email bucket means a prober who
 * counts carefully can learn that SOMEONE recently requested a code for an
 * address (activity), which is weaker than learning the address is registered
 * (existence) and costs the prober real emails delivered to the victim on the way.
 * We accept that; the alternative — answering a limited request with a fake
 * success — would lie to the legitimate user who tripped their own limit.
 *
 * ── FAIL CLOSED, AND WHERE IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ──
 *
 * A limiter that cannot read its own state does not know whether this is the
 * first request or the thousandth, so it refuses. The one place that inverts is
 * CAPACITY: when the in-memory store is full it evicts its oldest key rather than
 * refusing, because refusing would hand an attacker a total sign-in outage for
 * the price of a few thousand requests, and the allowance still bounds spend.
 *
 * ── THE NUMBERS ARE CODE, NOT OPERATOR CONFIG ──
 *
 * Unlike `LIVE_RUN_ALLOWANCE` (a product-facing number a human reads) these
 * limits are internal tuning for a backstop, so they are constants with a stated
 * rationale rather than env knobs nobody would ever set. They are injectable for
 * tests, and the sentence a user sees derives from no numeral at all.
 *
 * ── THE COUNTERS ARE DURABLE NOW, AND THE KEY IS WHY THAT WORKS ──
 *
 * This module used to record the limit's own defect: state lived in the process,
 * which on serverless means PER INSTANCE, so the effective limit was the constant
 * times however many instances were warm. The number in the code was not the
 * number the internet met.
 *
 * {@link resolveOtpRateLimiter} now picks a Supabase-backed
 * {@link OtpRateLimitStore} whenever Supabase is configured, on exactly the test
 * `getRunRepository()` uses, with the in-memory store as the offline fallback.
 * Moving the rows was only half of it: the bucket KEY is a salted digest, and a
 * per-process salt would have given every instance its own private bucket inside
 * the shared table, multiplying the limit exactly as before with a database bill
 * attached. So the salt is injected, and the durable path derives ONE salt that
 * every instance computes identically (see {@link resolveOtpRateLimiter}).
 *
 * The platform firewall's rate limiting still sits in front of all of it.
