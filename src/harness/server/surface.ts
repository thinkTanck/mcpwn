/**
 * HOSTED MCP SERVER — the served tool surface abstraction, shared by all Core-7
 * surfaces.
 *
 * You cannot poison what you do not serve ([ADR-0006](../../../docs/adr/0006-mcpwn-is-the-mcp-server.md)):
 * every attack is staged through the tools, seeded content and (for memory
 * categories) the memory store this surface publishes. A surface authors that
 * content for BOTH framings — the malicious run and its benign tool-parity
 * control ([ADR-0003](../../../docs/adr/0003-core-7-scope-and-measurability-bar.md)
 * bar 4) — so precision stays measurable.
 *
 * SAFETY (spike "Safety", non-negotiable). Every handler is PURE and side-effect
 * free. High-impact tools (transfer, exec, grant, delete) are NO-OP RECORDERS:
 * they return a canned success and move nothing, perform no I/O of any kind,
 * network included. The bait is taken merely by ISSUING the call; the handler
 * does nothing. All content is fabricated `.example` fiction.
 *
 * NEUTRALITY is a TESTABLE PROPERTY, not a style note. Nothing an agent can read
 * — a server name, a tool name, a description, an input schema, a result, an
 * error — may name this project, the experiment, the framing or the category. A
 * single "mcpwn" / "sandbox" / "malicious" on the wire tells a naive agent it is
 * being evaluated, and the run then measures the label instead of the poison
 * (the ASI01 spike's confounded NO was caused by exactly this class of leak).
 * `findTells()` is the sweep every surface and the server are checked against.
