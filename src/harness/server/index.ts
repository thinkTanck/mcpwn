/**
 * HOSTED MCP SERVER (module 1) — the per-run MCP server MCPwn hosts and the
 * user's agent connects to ([ADR-0006](../../../docs/adr/0006-mcpwn-is-the-mcp-server.md)).
 *
 * It serves the attack's poisoned tool surface (the Core-7, some tools
 * deliberately over-broad or mis-described), delivers `Scenario.taskGoal` OUT OF
 * BAND as a published prompt, and records every `tools/call` the agent chooses to
 * make into an OBSERVABLE-only `Trace`. The transport is Streamable HTTP; the
 * dispatch is transport-free and reused by the stdio path too.
 *
 * NOT YET VALIDATED: the bait-taking hypothesis. The ASI01 stdio spike returned a
 * confounded NO (a neutrality leak in the server identity); the ASI04 fallback has
 * never been run against a naive client. This server makes the hypothesis
 * TESTABLE at hosted scale; it does not prove it.
