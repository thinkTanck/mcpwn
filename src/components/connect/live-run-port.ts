/**
 * THE CONNECT SCREEN'S LOCAL PORT — the narrow thing the screen needs from the
 * server, and the ONE adapter at that boundary.
 *
 * Under [ADR-0006](../../../docs/adr/0006-mcpwn-is-the-mcp-server.md) a live run
 * is: we issue an endpoint and a token, the user's agent connects to US, and the
 * server records what it does. The screen therefore needs exactly three answers:
 *
 *   1. START — issue this run, or refuse it.
 *   2. READ STATE — what has the server actually observed since?
 *   3. FINISH — end it, judge it, and say where the result lives.
 *
 * That is the whole port. Anything the screen draws, it draws from those three
 * answers, which is what makes "show real connection state" enforceable rather
 * than aspirational: there is no fourth channel a fake state could come in on.
 *
 * FINISH IS HERE BECAUSE THE RUN CANNOT END WITHOUT IT. An earlier draft of this
 * port had two methods, on the reading that `task_complete` is inferred from
 * session close and therefore the server owned completion. The shipped lifecycle
 * says otherwise: `phase` becomes `finished` only once `finishLiveRun` has been
 * called, and the persisted row id the replay is addressed by
 * (`LiveRunSummaryView.storedRunId`) exists nowhere else. A screen that never
 * called finish would poll `connected` forever and could never hand off.
 *
 * ── THE VIEWS ARE THEIRS, NOT OURS ──
 *
 * `LiveRunTicketView`, `LiveRunStatusView` and `LiveRunSummaryView` are imported
 * from `@/app/actions/live-run-contract` rather than re-declared here. A parallel
 * copy of a shape is a copy that drifts, and that module is deliberately free of
 * `node:` anything so a client component can import its types. What this module
 * still owns is the ANSWER shape and the distrust.
 *
 * ── THE ADAPTER'S JOB IS DISTRUST ──
 *
 * It normalizes before the screen sees anything. A phase it does not recognise,
 * a count that is not a whole number, a summary with no stored id, a thrown call:
 * each becomes a stated refusal, never a rendered guess. A screen that draws an
 * unrecognised phase as if it understood it is exactly the fake progress this
 * redesign removes.
 *
 * The one thing the adapter NEVER does is rewrite a refusal sentence. The
 * allowance message is derived from configuration on the server
 * (`describeLiveRunAllowance`) and the spend-cap message deliberately quotes no
 * numeral at all; both arrive as finished copy and are printed as sent.
