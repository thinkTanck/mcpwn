/**
 * THE PHONE NOTE: what a visitor on a phone can do from Connect.
 *
 * Running a test means registering an MCP endpoint with an agent, which needs a
 * terminal or a code editor. A phone has neither, and the screen used to leave
 * the visitor to find that out at the last step. So below 768px it says so
 * first, and points at the three things that do work from a phone.
 *
 * ── HIDDEN BY CSS, NEVER BY SCRIPT ──
 *
 * `md:hidden` is `display: none` from 768px up, so on a desk the note is out of
 * layout and out of the accessibility tree. There is no width read in script:
 * no window listener, nothing to hydrate, and so no flash of the note on a wide
 * screen before a script takes it away again.
 *
 * ── INFORMATION, SO INERT ──
 *
 * Nothing has gone wrong and nothing is at risk, so this is neither the breach
 * red nor the caution amber. It wears the neutral fourth state
 * (`--status-inert`, ADR-0003) as a mark beside a label, never colour alone.
 * It is a `note`, not an alert and not a live region: it is there on arrival
 * and announces nothing by itself.
 *
 * It cannot be dismissed, because the fact does not stop being true, and it
 * hides, disables and moves nothing else on the screen. The sentence is READING
 * prose on the measure; only the small label is INSTRUMENT.
