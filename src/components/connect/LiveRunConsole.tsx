/**
 * THE LIVE CONSOLE — the Connect screen under the inverted model
 * ([ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-mcpwn-is-the-mcp-server.md)).
 *
 * The old panel asked for the user's agent endpoint and API key so we could call
 * them. We never call their agent. This panel does the inverse and says so on the
 * face of it: it ISSUES a per-run endpoint and token, explains how the task goal
 * reaches the agent when the protocol has no way to push it, and then WAITS on
 * state the server really observed.
 *
 * ── THE THREE RULES THIS PANEL IS BUILT AROUND ──
 *
 * 1. THE TOKEN IS A SECRET SHOWN ONCE. It lives in React state for the life of
 *    this component and nowhere else: no input element, no storage, no URL, no
 *    log. It is masked until revealed and copies while masked.
 *
 * 2. A STATE WE CANNOT OBSERVE IS NOT DRAWN. There is no progress bar, because
 *    there is no total; no "the agent is thinking", because reasoning is not
 *    observable from the server side and is never synthesized. Every phase on
 *    screen came from a real reading, dated with when it was taken.
 *
 * 3. A REFUSAL FAILS CLOSED AND SAYS SO CALMLY. The allowance sentence is derived
 *    from configuration on the server and the spend-cap sentence quotes no
 *    numeral at all; this component prints what it was handed and authors
 *    neither. Refusals wear CAUTION, never the breach red: being out of free runs
 *    is not a compromise.
 *
 * ── WHY TOOL CALLS ARE THE HEADLINE NUMBER, NOT STEPS ──
 *
 * `LiveRunStatusView.steps` counts the whole observable trace, which includes the
 * principal instruction we put there ourselves and the inferred completion step.
 * It is therefore NEVER zero on a live run: a run where the agent connected and
 * did nothing at all still reports steps. Printing that under a label like "steps
 * recorded" would assert activity that never happened, on the one panel whose
 * entire job is showing real state. So the DISPLAY numeral is `toolCalls` — the
 * calls the agent itself chose to make, which is the signal a red-team run is
 * actually watching — and `steps` is shown beside it, named for what it is and
 * with its two inclusions stated.
