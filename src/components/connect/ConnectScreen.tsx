/**
 * CONNECT / RUN SETUP — the targeting console (register: PRODUCT).
 *
 * ── THE INVERSION THIS SCREEN EXISTS TO EXPRESS ──
 *
 * The retired console asked for the user's agent endpoint and API key so that we
 * could call their agent. [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-mcpwn-is-the-mcp-server.md)
 * reversed that: MCProof IS the MCP server, and the user's agent connects to US.
 * So the screen no longer TAKES a target, it ISSUES one — a per-run endpoint and
 * a per-run token — and then waits on the real connection.
 *
 * The clearest signal of the inversion is what is missing: there is no field on
 * this screen at all. Nothing to type, nothing to paste, no credential of the
 * user's for us to promise to look after.
 *
 * ── ONE CATEGORY PER RUN ──
 *
 * The old console offered a seven-box checklist, which made sense when a run was
 * a batch of calls we made. It does not now: a run is ONE hosted endpoint serving
 * ONE attack `Environment`, because the environment IS the attack. So the
 * checklist is a radio group, and the same choice drives both modes — in sample
 * it picks which recorded run plays, in live it picks which surface we serve.
 *
 * ── TYPE ROLES ──
 *
 * Every sentence is a READING role (sans). Labels, chips and machine values are
 * INSTRUMENT (mono, 12-13px). The one DISPLAY value on the screen is the recorded
 * step count in the live console, which is evidence and is therefore printed as
 * read, never animated.
