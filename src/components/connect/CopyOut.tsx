/**
 * A value the user has to move OUT of this screen and into their agent: the run
 * endpoint, the run token, the task goal.
 *
 * Two type roles, picked per value and not by taste. An endpoint or a token is
 * TELEMETRY — a machine string, so it wears the INSTRUMENT role (mono readout).
 * The task goal is a SENTENCE A HUMAN READS before pasting it, so it wears the
 * READING role. Prose never renders at instrument size on this screen, which is
 * a blocking rule rather than a preference.
 *
 * ── SECRETS ──
 *
 * `secret` masks the value on screen while still copying the real one. The mask
 * is a CONSTANT, not derived from the value, so it cannot leak the length. This
 * is not encryption and does not pretend to be: the point is that a screen-shared
 * or shoulder-surfed Connect page does not spill a live credential, while the one
 * legitimate use (paste it into your agent) still works in a single click.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `<input>` here. A form control is what a password
 * manager or an autofill store latches onto, and the run token must not be
 * persisted by anything, the browser included.
 *
 * ── `display`: A COMMAND THAT CARRIES A SECRET ──
 *
 * A ready-to-run client command has to contain the real run token or it does not
 * work, and it must not put that token on screen or the whole `secret` treatment
 * above is undone by the block underneath it. So `display` splits the two: it is
 * what gets RENDERED, while `value` is what gets COPIED.
 *
 * The caller builds the two strings SEPARATELY (see `ClientSetup`), rather than
 * rendering the real command through a find-and-replace. A replace that misses,
 * or a token that happens to contain a regex-special character, would print the
 * credential; a string built from a mask has never held it.
 *
 * ── `tone="code"` ──
 *
 * A command is code: mono, never wrapped (a broken line is a broken command),
 * and scrolled INSIDE its own box so the page body never scrolls sideways. A box
 * that scrolls has to be reachable from the keyboard (WCAG 2.1.1), so it carries
 * `tabIndex` and a name of its own.
