/**
 * HOW TO ACTUALLY CONNECT: one three-step setup, the same for six agents.
 *
 * The console issues a correct endpoint, a correct token and a correct goal. This
 * section is the only place that says what the reader has to DO with them. It
 * used to be four tabs of four different shapes (five steps, a dialog that could
 * not connect, two editors in one tab, a nine-step walk of the whole run), so a
 * first-time reader had to learn a new layout for every client. Now every tab is
 * the same three steps under the same three names:
 *
 *   1. Connect           ONE paste-ready config block built for this run, one
 *                        line on the client's other MCP servers, and the live
 *                        connection reading under it.
 *   2. Give it the job   the task goal, with a copy control.
 *   3. Finish            "When your agent is done, End run and judge."
 *
 * ── THE TABS ──
 *
 * Claude Code, GitHub Copilot / VS Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Other agent.
 * No tab is selected until the reader picks one, so no vendor reads as the way
 * in. The Claude desktop app's CHAT side has no tab: its custom connector dialog
 * has no field for a header, so it cannot carry the run token. One line under
 * the tabs says that for every chat app at once.
 *
 * ── THE RULES THIS SECTION IS BUILT AROUND ──
 *
 * 1. A REAL CONFIG, NOT A DESCRIPTION OF ONE. Every block is built from the
 *    issued ticket, so it is the config for THIS run and not a template with
 *    placeholders to fill in. The builders live in `@/lib/mcp/config`, one per
 *    client, each in the format that client's own documentation gives (read
 *    2026-10-10; the URLs are beside the builders).
 *
 * 2. A COMMAND HAS TO SURVIVE THE READER'S SHELL. Every command here is
 *    byte-for-byte the same in bash and in PowerShell, and its label says so.
 *    That is why Claude Code's `add-json` form is not offered (Windows
 *    PowerShell strips the quotes inside its JSON) and why the folder command
 *    uses `;` and not `&&`.
 *
 * 3. THE TOKEN IS COPYABLE WITHOUT BEING VISIBLE. A working config has to carry
 *    the credential, and a credential rendered inside a code block undoes the
 *    masking on the token block above it. So each snippet is BUILT TWICE from
 *    the same function: once with the real token (that string is only ever
 *    handed to the clipboard) and once with a constant mask (that string is the
 *    only one that reaches the DOM). It is deliberately not a find-and-replace
 *    over the real text: a replace that misses prints the credential, and a
 *    string built from a mask has never held it.
 *
 * 4. ISOLATION IS STATED FIRST, AND AGAIN IN EVERY TAB. The tools this endpoint
 *    serves are hostile by design, so an agent that also holds live connectors
 *    can carry an injected instruction out to a real system. The warning sits
 *    above the picker, and step 1 of each tab then carries the one isolation
 *    move its own client really has: Claude Code's `--strict-mcp-config` with
 *    `--mcp-config` (verified against 2.1.286), Gemini CLI's
 *    `--allowed-mcp-server-names`, Codex's `enabled = false`, the server lists
 *    in VS Code and Cursor. No flag is offered that was not read off the
 *    client's own help or documentation. A client that runs from a folder is
 *    started in a new, empty one, so no file of the reader's is in reach.
 *
 * 5. A FILE THAT IS NOT OURS IS ADDED TO, NEVER REPLACED. Four tabs save a new
 *    file inside the new folder. Codex reads a file in the home folder that the
 *    reader may already rely on, so its block is one table to ADD to that file,
 *    and the step says to remove it after the run. Every file holds the token in
 *    plain text, and every tab says so.
 *
 * 6. THE STATUS IS THE CONSOLE'S, NOT A SECOND OPINION. The reading under step 1
 *    is the phase `LiveRunConsole` already polls for and passes down. This
 *    component reads nothing from the server. It replaces the old CHECK IT TOOK
 *    paragraph, which described the connection panel instead of showing it.
 *
 * 7. UNTESTED IS SAID, AND IT IS NOT A WARNING. Four of the six tabs were
 *    written from documentation and have not been run by us. They carry an
 *    UNTESTED tag in the inert fourth state, icon plus label: never caution and
 *    never red, because an untested config is not a failing one.
 *
 * ── THE CODE PANEL ROUTE ──
 *
 * The Claude desktop app's Code panel is Claude Code, and it keeps a route of
 * its own UNDER the Claude Code steps, marked NOT RECOMMENDED: as tested in the
 * desktop app, the panel has no `/mcp` command and loads every connector the app
 * has, so it cannot be limited to the run's server. The warning comes before its
 * steps and sends the reader to the terminal route.
